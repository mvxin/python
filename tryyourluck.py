# This, obviously, won't actually gather any useful data. Proof of concept.
# It generates a random seed, then a random private and public key.
# It checks the public key balance. If > 0 we save it, else, it's discarded.
# You need the bip39 seed list: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt
# Run with: python3 generate_addresses.py
